Lugaru \- free and open source ninja rabbit fighting game
.SH DESCRIPTION
Lugaru (pronounced Loo-GAH-roo) is a cross-platform third-person action game.
The main character, Turner, is an anthropomorphic rebel bunny rabbit with
impressive combat skills. In his quest to find those responsible for
slaughtering his village, he uncovers a far-reaching conspiracy involving the
corrupt leaders of the rabbit republic and the starving wolves from a nearby
den. Turner takes it upon himself to fight against their plot and save his
fellow rabbits from slavery.
